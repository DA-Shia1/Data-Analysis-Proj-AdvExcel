Introduction - Product Data Analysis using Adv-Excel

The aim of the Product sales data analysis is to uncover invaluable information that can help us decide whether to adjust prices or increase or decrease or discontinue the supply of the products on the basis of various factors.

If we do a detailed analysis and look at the products and the profit these products are bringing to the company, we surely can stand in a position to make some important decisions about these products and the better growth of the company. 
Whereas, not only the products but analysing the performance of the Sales persons in the targeted geographies also give us some more specific insights like, which and where the sales persons are performing better comparatively, where the sales are more uniform for a particular product, where we may need to reposition the products or target a specific customer demographic.

Finally, these analysis help us to make more data specific changes like where the marketing tactics can be changed in order to provide better sales, or which products to discontinue and in which location.
